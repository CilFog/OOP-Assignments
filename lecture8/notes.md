## 3. Explain, in your own words, the process of test-driven development.
    First you prepare the functions and it's needed component. These component need be as simple as possible.
    Secondly you arrange the function, so that all that is needed, is to test whether it works or not.
    Thirdly, you assert the function to test it you expected out equals the  actual output. Make sure, that if a function needs to cover a wide 
    range of different numbers, you check the needed range.
